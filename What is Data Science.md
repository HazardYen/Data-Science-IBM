## Course Syllabus
### Module 1 - Defining Data Science
- What is Data Science?
    - Data science is the field of exploring, manipulating, and analyzing data, and using data to answer questions or make recommendations.
    - Data science is the art of uncovering the insights and trends that are hiding behind data. 
    - It's when you translate data into a story. So use storytelling to generate insight. And with these insights, you can make strategic choices for a company or an institution.
    - Data science is a field about processes and systems to extract data from various forms of whether it is unstructured or structured form.
- Fundamentals of Data Science
    -  Data science can help organizations understand their environments, analyze existing issues, and reveal previously hidden opportunities. Data scientists use data analysis to add to the knowledge of the organization by investigating data, exploring the best way to use it to provide value to the business.
    -  Many organizations will use data science to focus on a specific problem, and so it's essential to clarify the question that the organization wants answered. This first and most crucial step defines how the data science project progresses. Good data scientists are curious people who ask questions to clarify the business need. The next questions are: "what data do we need to solve the problem, and where will that data come from?". Data scientists can analyze structured and unstructured data from many sources, and depending on the nature of the problem, they can choose to analyze the data in different ways.
    -  When the data has revealed its insights, the role of the data scientist becomes that of a storyteller, communicating the results to the project stakeholders.
    -  Data Science is changing the way we work; it's changing the way we use data and it’s changing the way organisations understand the world.
- The Many Paths to Data Science
    - Contemporary data scientists come from different backgrounds such as engineering, mathematics, and even psychology. The secret skill is passion for continuous learning of new tools and patience to clean and analyze data.
- Advice for New Data Scientists
    - An aspiring data scientist is to be curious, extremely argumentative and judgmental. Curiosity is absolute must. If you're not curious, you would not know what to do with the data. Judgmental because if you do not have preconceived notions about things you wouldn't know where to begin with. Argumentative because if you can argument and if you can plead a case, at least you can start somewhere and then you learn from data and then you modify your assumptions and hypotheses and your data would help you learn. And you might start at the wrong point. You may say that I thought I believed this, but now with data I know this.
    - The most important thing is curiosity and the ability to take positions.
    - The last thing that a data scientist need, and that is the ability to tell a story.
    - Figure out first what you're interested, and what is your competitive advantage. Your competitive advantage is not necessarily going to be your analytical skills. Your competitive advantage is your understanding of some aspect of life where you exceed beyond others in understanding that.
